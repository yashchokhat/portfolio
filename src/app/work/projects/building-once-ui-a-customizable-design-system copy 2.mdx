## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using React and styled-components in Next.js, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.

## Technologies Used

- **React JS**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Firebase**: Secure Database by Google.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Mordern CSS Library.

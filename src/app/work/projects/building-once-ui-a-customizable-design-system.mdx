## Overview

Development of a flexible and highly customizable design system using Next.js for front-end and Figma for design collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using React and styled-components in Next.js, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Figma Integration**: Collaborated closely with designers by setting up a shared design library in Figma. This library was synchronized with the codebase, ensuring design handoffs were seamless and that design tokens remained consistent across both platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **React JS**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Firebase**: Secure Database by Google.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Mordern CSS Library.

This project focuses on developing a smart home automation system from scratch, utilizing the ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontroller, Firebase for realtime data management, and cross-platform mobile app development. The system is designed to control four or more home appliances remotely, while also providing realtime monitoring of room temperature, humidity. By integrating the ESP8266 with Firebase, the project ensures reliable, real-time communication between the hardware and the mobile app, allowing users to manage their home environment efficiently and with ease. The Smart Home Automation & Security System is an advanced solution designed to enhance
convenience, efficiency, and safety in modern homes. This system integrates cutting-edge
technologies, enabling users to control devices remotely, monitor environmental conditions in real-time, and ensure home security with intelligent automation. Its include multi-user login, AI & voice assistance, device timers, IR
remote control, and real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and air quality (AQI).
